# Purchase Request Detail Page

Frontend homework challenge — หน้าแสดงรายละเอียดใบขอซื้อ (Purchase Request) พร้อม Approval Flow Timeline

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **React 19** + **TypeScript** | UI framework with type safety |
| **Vite 7** | Build tool — fast HMR and optimized production builds |
| **Tailwind CSS 4** | Utility-first CSS framework (`@tailwindcss/vite` plugin) |
| **Lucide React** | Lightweight SVG icon library |

## Features

- **Step-by-step Approval Flow** — Approve advances one step at a time (JM → CJ → TB → Approved), navbar avatar updates to reflect the current approver
- **Mock API with fetch pattern** — `mockFetch()` simulates server-side logic via `Response` object, ready to swap for real `fetch()` calls
- **Approval Flow Timeline** — Visual timeline with status icons, connecting lines, and user info
- **Conditional Action Buttons** — Approve/Reject buttons shown based on permissions and current step
- **Responsive Layout** — Two-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile

```

## Assumptions

- Mock API layer (`src/services/mockApi.ts`) simulates backend responses with 1s delay
- Approve flow is step-by-step: each click advances to the next approver until final approval
- Reject terminates at the current step immediately
- Attachment files are mock/placeholder data

## Future Improvements

- Swap `mockFetch()` for real `fetch()` — only `mockApi.ts` needs to change
- Add confirmation dialogs before approve/reject
- Add file upload and download for attachments
- Add routing (React Router) for multi-page navigation
- Add animation effects (card fade-in, page transitions)
- Add E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress
