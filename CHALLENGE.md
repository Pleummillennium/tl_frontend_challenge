# Frontend Challenge — Approval Request Viewer

## Background / Story

You are a **Frontend Engineer** working on an **Internal Approval Platform**. The backend team has already finalized the API contract and data structure, but the frontend screens still need to be implemented.

In this sprint, your task is to **implement the frontend screens (from the provided design)** based on the provided design. The actual backend integration will happen in a future sprint, so for now you will work with **mocked API data** (frontend-homework-challenge-mock.json).

This assignment focuses on how you structure your frontend code, design reusable components, and deliver a clean and responsive user experience.

## Goal of This Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate:

- Code quality and readability
- Component structure and reusability
- State and data handling

> Pixel-perfect design matching is **not required**
>
> No real backend integration is required
